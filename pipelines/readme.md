#### Pipelines ####

A CRISPR processing pipeline for processing GESTALT lineage barcoding data. It runs on the [GATK Queue](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=queue) engine.  I haven't checked in the jar file for Queue, as it's best to build it yourself with the most up-to-date version.  The version we used to produce the data in the paper is CRISPR_analysis_PE_V2.scala, though this version has evolved significantly throughout our publications.
